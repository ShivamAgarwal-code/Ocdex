# Ocdex

Inspiration
My inspiration to build the Ocdex came from how successful Redacted and Convex have been on the EVM. We believe that a system like this has been lacking in the IBC for a long time and we have seen governance be overhauled by insider interest, and incentives be directed to users/protocols that were not aligned with the protocols that bootstrapped, and harboured them. As a team that has survived, the fantom debacle solidly, the Terra/UST collapse and the inevitable FTX collapse of capital we stayed confident and interested to build and contribute to the better and ethical future of crypto.

What it does
Ocdex acts as a broker for users that have voting power. We currently were supporting the Comdex ecosystem with Veharbor, to maximize the emissions for harbor to swap pools. Ultimately, the project on Comdex has been put on because of complications with their products. So we decided to build it on chains that support 2 protocols, Astroport and Mars. With astroport, you can delegate your VP to Ocdex, and Ocdex will make a bribe marketplace interface that allows protocols to place bribes for emissions to the pools that they want emissions to be directed to. A fairly simple idea, where we act as a broker and 3rd party that helps support efficient liquidity distribution and allow new pairs to bootstrap efficiently without pool 3 dilution.

How we built it:
We have not built the Astroport interface yet, nor for Mars, since we were encouraged later to enter the hackathon we will develop it over the coming weeks, we do have a mockup for what we were building on Comdex.

## Challenges we ran into: We ran into a few challenges on Comdex,

PMF: Our product market fit since it hasn't been built was hard to test because it relies on the success of the underlying protocols its built on, we realized this so we decided to co-market with Comdex and then later on look for a new ecosystem that has already been established, so we can have a better gauge on if the product will be sticky and attract users.

## What's next for Ocdex
Ocdex is ready to take on the IBC and protocols that want to work with us on helping onboard users and protocols that align with values we were built on, ethics and integrity. We are open to exploring chains, and a new home such as Osmosis, Neutron or Injective!
